# What is this program?
It is important to accurately predict the price of green onions for our household expenditure because almost every food ingredient we eat includes green onions. I made a program that predicts the price of green onions by entering average temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, and precipitation.

# Description
data.csv : File pre-processing of information on average temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, precipitation, and daily wave prices.

OSS_final_learning : File that creates and learns learning models with preprocessed data.

Predict : File that takes input from average temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, and precipitation and predicts the price of the wave based on training data(OSS_final_learning file).
